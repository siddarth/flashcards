== ABOUT

I came across the NATO Alphabet, and really wanted to become semi-proficient.
I needed a way to practice/test myself, so I wrote a script to generate a few
tests.

== USAGE

    $ git clone git://github.com/siddarth/nato-alphabet.git

    $ cd nato-alphabet

    $ ruby nato-alphabet <action>

Action, here, takes one of two possible values:
1. all (default):
    the script will cycle from a-z, and ask you to enter the word for each
    letter.
2. random:
    randomly picks a letter and asks for the word for it.

You can exit at any time by breaking (CTRL-C).

== EXAMPLE

  $ ruby nato-alphabet.rb all

Enter the telephony for the letter A: Alfa
Correct.

Enter the telephony for the letter B: Beta
Incorrect. The correct answer is 'Bravo'.

Enter the telephony for the letter C: Charlie
Correct.

Enter the telephony for the letter D: ^C
